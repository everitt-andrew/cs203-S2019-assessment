* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
 language)

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk

## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about
 * Python software development
  * N = a lack of new knowledge and/or contributions to any project
  * I = incomplete knowledge or minuscule contributions to projects
  * A = an average amount of knowledge and contributions to each project
  * G = an above average amount of knowledge and contributions to each project
  * E = going above and beyond the expectations and contributions of others
 * Project management with GitHub, specifically the Flow Model
  * N = a complete disregard for the model, especially multiple instances of overriding the master branch
  * I = occasional disregard for the model including overriding the master branch
  * A = almost always adhering to model, but never overriding the master branch
  * G = making only minor mistakes while trying to follow the model and providing a positive influence on other aspects such as issues and communication
  * E = a lack of mistakes in addition to emerging as a leader who provides support to others who may be struggling with project management
 * Continuous integration with Travis
  * N = failing to enable Travis at all or not passing any requirements on any assignment
  * I = enabling Travis, but failing the majority of checks
  * A = enabling Travis, and passing a majority of Travis checks
  * G = enabling Travis, and passing all of the Travis checks
  * E = enabling Travis, passing all checks, and assisting others who are struggling or improving issues with Travis if found
 * Foundations of software engineering practices
  * N = working separate from a team with no communication
  * I = working with a team a small amount of the time with no communication
  * A = working well with a team half of the time with very little communication
  * G = working well with a team most of the time with clear communication
  * E = working well with a team all of the time with clear and constructive communication
* Understanding and avoiding red flags
 * N = ignoring all red flags
 * I = would be identifying red flags, but not fixing them
 * A = identifying and fixing a red flag
 * G = identifying, understanding and fixing a red flag to prevent future bugs
 * E = identifying, understanding, and fixing all red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices
 * N = a severe lack of understanding and refusal to adopt best practices
 * I = slight understanding and occasional use and identification of the best practices
 * A = an average amount of understanding and general identification and use of best practices
 * G = above average demonstrations of understanding and the ability to find and utilize best practices
 * E = full understanding of concepts, would also include the ability to determine which practices are better than others and then applying those practices

### Group

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
* Participation
* Conduct
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
* Infractions

### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
* Interaction with the team leaders
* Interaction with the course instructor
* Interaction with the teaching assistants

## Revision of Guides
* Revising the assessment form
 * N = not reading the assessment form nor making contributions to it
 * I = not reading the assessment form in its final state, but making minor contributions thus improving the initial state
 * A = a complete understanding of the assessment form and some contributions in order to enhance it
 * G = a complete understanding of the assessment form and multiple contributions to improve it
 * E = a complete understanding of the assessment form, major contributions, and continuing to improve it throughout the semester as needed
* Revising the code of conduct
 * N = not reading the code of conduct nor making contributions to it
 * I = not reading the code of conduct in its final state, but making minor contributions thus improving the initial state
 * A = a complete understanding of the code of conduct and some contributions in order to enhance it
 * G = a complete understanding of the code of conduct and multiple contributions to improve it
 * E = a complete understanding of the code of conduct, major contributions, and continuing to improve it throughout the semester as needed
